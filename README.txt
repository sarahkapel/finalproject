This repository is for my final project in Reproducible Science. My goals for this project is to manage and clean my data and "dummy data" for my final project.

ORGANIZATION:
Each fire footprint has their own folder which will contain the code and figures for the project. 
The "raw data" is saved in a read-only file. 
In the gitignore, I will ignore all files with .docx, .png, and .jpegs
