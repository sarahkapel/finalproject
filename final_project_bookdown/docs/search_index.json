For this project, I used my own data from my research. The first chapter will provide some context to my research and also explain how I reorganized my original datasheets after learning about good spreadsheet practices. In the second chapter,I demonstrate how I created a database for each aspen seedling. In the third chapter, I visualize simulated data to see how to illustrate my future results. bookdown::serve_book() "],["about-my-research-and-re-organizing-my-data.html", "Chapter 2 About my research and re-organizing my data 2.1 About my research 2.2 Organizing my data", " Chapter 2 About my research and re-organizing my data In this chapter I will explain my research project. I will also explain how I reorganized initial data I complied because I learned some important lessons in spreadsheets. 2.1 About my research Aspen are an important foundational forest species. Populations in the west are declining due to herbivory, altered disturbance regimes, drought, and climate change. Restoration of the species has historically been accomplished by clear-felling existing stands to encourage vegetative suckering. This works well to regenerate existing clones with healthy rootstock and herbivory pressure is low. However, this approach cannot be used where aspen stands do not already exist and limits genetic variation. Outplanting with seedlings is an understudied aspect of aspen restoration. A major opportunity presented by the increase in large fires in the West is planting seedlings in fire footprints. For my research project, I will investigate the feasibility of planting aspen seedlings in a post-fire environment. This project was conducted in three recently burned forests across the Southwest. Seedlings were planted with three treatments: 1) in the root pockets of snags, 2) along logs, 3) in open spaces. We believe snags may be beneficial because moisture will be wicked to the seedlings and there may be higher soil moisture in the root pockets. We will investigate what treatments are beneficial to seedling growth and vigor as well as azimuth around the structure. We also will investigate differences in soil moisture amongst treatments. Finally, this project will look at the efficacy of vexar tubing to protect aspen seedlings from herbivory. My field work started in the fall of 2022 when I planted ~360 seedlings per fire footprint. At this time I recorded information for each seedling. This included baseline measurements of the seedlings root collar diameter and height. I recorded the seedlings ground cover in various classes and information on the nearest woody neighbor within 2 meters. I also took information about each treatment and the site. I will come back to each site this summer to remeasure those that survive. I will also take soil moisture measurements over the summer from data loggers I install. 2.2 Organizing my data Prior to this class, I complied all my digitized paper datasheets onto one single excel file. I realized that this would be problematic for many reasons. It took time to correct my mistakes, but ultimately it will help me in the long run. 2.2.1 My old data Here is a screenshot of how my old data looked. Fig. 1: Diagram of database structure I color coded objects, merged cells, and had multiple sheets. 2.2.2 My new data From this class, I learned the error in my ways and I quickly remade my datasheets.. Here is a screenshot of my new data. Fig. 1: Diagram of database structure First, I used csv instead of excel since that is better compatible with R. I removed any color coding since that will not translate in R. I also removed merged cells since that will cause issues working in R. I also separated all pages from the one excel file into various single page csv documents.

I have roughly 1,000 seedlings planted in four sites under three treatments across the Southwest. For this project, I will follow this database structure. Figure 3.1: Diagram illustrating the structure of the database 3.2 Creating the database This is the code we used to create the database. Well start with loading our packages. I will need DBI and RSQLite packages. I will also download some other packages that might be of use later on. library(DBI) library(RSQLite) library(ggplot2) library(tidyverse) library (lubridate) First, were going to start by establishing a connection to a SQLite database. aspen_db &lt;- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite()) 3.2.1 Creating the measurements table This table includes all baseline-measurement information about each seedling across all three fire footprints. I do not have information from repeat measurements yet. The table includes columns for tag id, measurement id, date, height of seedlings, root collar diameter of seedlings, site information, recorder information, survivorship status, and herbivory status. The primary key is the measurement id which will reflect when the measurement was done. dbExecute(aspen_db, &quot;CREATE TABLE measurements ( tag_id varchar(4) NOT NULL, measurement_id varchar (5) NOT NULL, date varchar (10), height varchar (4), rcd varchar (4), site_name varchar, structure_id varchar (2), structure_type varchar (1), recorder varchar (10), status varchar (5), herbivory varchar (1), PRIMARY KEY (measurement_id) );&quot;) measurements &lt;- read.csv(&quot;measurements.csv&quot;,stringsAsFactors = FALSE) dbWriteTable(aspen_db, &quot;measuremements&quot;, measurements, append = TRUE) 3.2.2 Creating the sites table This table includes information about each site within the three fire footprints. There are four sites total. The table includes columns for fire footprint, site id, elevation, and forest name. The primary key is the fire. dbExecute(aspen_db, &quot;CREATE TABLE sites ( fire varchar (9), site_id varchar (1), elevation varchar (5), forest varchar (16), PRIMARY KEY (site_id) );&quot;) sites &lt;- read.csv(&quot;sites.csv&quot;,stringsAsFactors = FALSE) dbWriteTable(aspen_db, &quot;sites&quot;, sites, append = TRUE) 3.2.3 Creating the soil moisture table This table includes information from the soil moisture sensors that will be installed in the Luna fire footprint. There is a column for logger_id, structure_id, and date. The logger id is the primary key. Since I dont know what this data will include and look like, it is empty for now. dbExecute(aspen_db, &quot;CREATE TABLE soil_moisture ( logger_id varchar (10), structure_id varchar (3), date varchar (10), PRIMARY KEY (logger_id) );&quot;) soil_moisture &lt;- read.csv(&quot;soil_moisture.csv&quot;, stringsAsFactors = FALSE) dbWriteTable(aspen_db, &quot;soil_moisture&quot;, soil_moisture, append = TRUE) 3.2.4 Creating the structures table This table includes information about each structure (or treatment) across all three fire footprints. There are columns for site name, site number, structure number, structure type, structure species (applicable for snags and logs), diameter at breast height (applicable for snags), decay class (applicable for snags and logs), vexar, photo number, and the utm coordinates. The primary key will be the photo number since each structure has its own photo. dbExecute(aspen_db, &quot;CREATE TABLE structures ( site_name varchar, site_no varchar (1), structure_no varchar (2), structure_type varchar (1), structure_sp varchar (5), dbh varchar (4), decay_class varchar (1), vexar varchar (1), photo_no varchar (6), utm_x varchar (15), utm_y varchar (15), PRIMARY KEY (photo_no) );&quot;) structures &lt;- read.csv(&quot;structures.csv&quot;, stringsAsFactors = FALSE) dbWriteTable(aspen_db, &quot;structures&quot;, structures, append = TRUE) "],["database-is-complete.html", "Chapter 4 Database is complete", " Chapter 4 Database is complete Yay!

Below is very simple code I used to create some data. I first manipulated the data using a binomial distribution. This randomly selected some seedlings to survive and some to die. Of those that survived, I increased the height by 40% and the RCD by 30%. Then I manually added more weight to the snag treatment. # load packages library(tidyverse) library(lme4) horton_man &lt;- read.csv(&quot;horton_man.csv&quot;) %&gt;% filter(is.na(site_no)== FALSE) # this is remnant code on how I did that: # horton_man &lt;- horton %&gt;% # mutate(measurement_id = case_when(tag_id != &quot;NA&quot; ~ paste0(tag_id,&quot;-02&quot;)), # status = rbinom(n=350,prob = .75, size = 1), # height = case_when(status==1 ~ height*1.4, # increase height by 40% # status==0 ~ height), # rcd = case_when(status == 1 ~ rcd*1.3, # increase rcd by 30% # status == 0 ~ rcd)) %&gt;% # filter(is.na(site_no) == FALSE) 5.2 Plotting the data using ggplot 5.2.1 Plot 1 Below is the code I used to generate a bar plot displaying how many seedlings survived in each treatment group. This is a simple plot but it does display what treatment yielded the most seedling survival. library(ggplot2) library(viridis) horton_man %&gt;% as_tibble() %&gt;% filter(status == 1) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = structure, fill = status)) + geom_bar(fill = &quot;light blue&quot;) + labs (x = &quot;Treatment&quot;, y = &quot;Count&quot;, title = &quot;Seedling Survival by Treatment&quot;) + theme_light() ### Plot 2 Below is code I used to plot the root collar diameter and height of each seedling in the Horton fire.
