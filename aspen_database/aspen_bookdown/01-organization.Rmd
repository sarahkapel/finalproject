# Background on my research and re-organizing my data

In this chapter I will explain my research project. I will also explain how I 
reorganized initial data I complied because I learned some important lessons in
spreadsheets. 

## About my research

Aspen are an important foundational forest species. Populations in the west are 
declining due to herbivory, altered disturbance regimes, drought, and climate 
change. Restoration of the species has historically been accomplished by 
clear-felling existing stands to encourage vegetative suckering. This works well 
to regenerate existing clones with healthy rootstock and herbivory pressure is 
low. However, this approach cannot be used where aspen stands do not already 
exist and limits genetic variation. Outplanting with seedlings is an 
understudied aspect of aspen restoration. A major opportunity presented by the 
increase in large fires in the West is planting seedlings in fire footprints. 
For my research project, I will investigate the feasibility of planting aspen 
seedlings in a post-fire environment. This project was conducted in three 
recently burned forests across the Southwest. Seedlings were planted with 
three treatments: 1) in the root pockets of snags, 2) along logs, 3) in open 
spaces. We believe snags may be beneficial because moisture will be wicked to 
the seedlings and there may be higher soil moisture in the root pockets. We will 
investigate what treatments are beneficial to seedling growth and vigor as well 
as azimuth around the structure. We also will investigate differences in soil 
moisture amongst treatments. Finally, this project will look at the efficacy of 
vexar tubing to protect aspen seedlings from herbivory. 

My field work started in the fall of 2022 when I planted ~360 seedlings per 
fire footprint. At this time I recorded information for each 
seedling. This included baseline measurements of the seedlings root collar
diameter and height. I recorded the seedlings ground cover in various classes 
and information on the nearest woody neighbor within 2 meters. I also took 
information about each treatment and the site. I will come back to each site 
this summer to remeasure those that survive. I will also take soil moisture 
measurements over the summer from data loggers I install. 

## Organizing my data 

Prior to this class, I complied all my digitized paper datasheets onto one 
single excel file. I realized that this would be problematic for many reasons.
It took time to correct my mistakes, but ultimately it will help me in the long 
run. 

### My old data 

Here is a screenshot of how my old data looked.

I color coded objects, merged cells, and had multiple sheets. 

### My new data 

From this class, I learned the error in my ways and I quickly remade my 
datasheets.. 

Here is a screenshot of my new data.

First, I used csv instead of excel since that is better compatible with R. 
I removed any color coding since that will not translate in R. I also removed
merged cells since that will cause issues working in R. I also separated all 
pages from the one excel file into various single page csv documents.
